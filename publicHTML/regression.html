				<p><a class="link">Does pollution removal by the urban forest in Camden change over time? Does it change homogeneously across wards?</a><br><br>
				Our hypothesis was that there would be an increase in pollution removal,
				due to the trees' natural growth and the consequential increase in their capacity
				to remove pollution (the bigger the tree, the larger the pollution removal).
				Therefore, we expected the increase to be relatively similar among wards.
				However, that was not what we found!</p>

					<p><a class="link">The London Plane tree pollution removal in Camden is predicted to increase significantly by an average of 7.7% per year.</a>
						<br>By 2025, it will have increased by 45%, compared to 2020, ranging from 15% in Kingâ€™s Cross, the lowest increase, to 70% in West Hampstead, the highest increase.
						<br><br>Overall, it is in the North and the North-West of the borough that there will be the highest increase in the pollution removed by London Planes.
						This could make the current hotspots of air pollution removal disappear, as the North could 'catch up' on the South's higher values of pollution removal.</p>
					<p> Another interesting finding is that the predictor associated with the highest increase in air pollution removal is 
						spread, which seems logic: the bigger the tree, the more pollution it will remove! The coefficient for height is much smaller, which could suggest that the physiological 
						attribute of the London Plane that correlates the most with air pollution removal is spread. </p>

					<h3>Model specification</h3>
					<p>
							The predictive tool uses Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to model
							the average pollution removal (grams/yr) for each London Plane tree based
							on its carbon sequestration (grams/yr), spread (m)
							and height (m). The model is shown as:
							<br><em><b> y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + b<sub>3</sub>x<sub>3</sub></b></em>
							<br> Where:
							<br> <b>y</b> is the predicted average pollution removal per London PLane tree
							<br> <b>b<sub>0</sub></b> is the constant term
							<br> <b>x<sub>1</sub></b> is carbon sequestration with coefficient <b>b<sub>1</sub></b>
							<br> <b>x<sub>2</sub></b> is tree spread with coefficient <b>b<sub>2</sub></b>
							<br> <b>x<sub>3</sub></b> is tree height with coefficient <b>b<sub>3</sub></b>
					</p>
					<p>
						With these estimated coefficients, the model results in:
							<br><b> y = -510.9830 -3.56 x<sub>1</sub> + 93.1614 x<sub>2</sub>+ 8.7374 x<sub>3</sub></b>
							<br> The model explains 89% of the variation in average air pollution removal for a sample size n of 3217 London Plane trees in Camden.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class = 'infoCard' id="selection">
					<h3>Model selection</h3>
					<p>The initial pool of predictors consisted of a multitude of variables based on our assessment of relevant variables in modelling pollution removal. The initial pre-selected variables were: height, spread, Diameter at Breast Height, physiological condition, <a href="https://www.ltoa.org.uk/resources/cavat" class="link">Capital Asset Value</a>, carbon storage and gross carbon sequestration.
						<br>The variables were then filtered twice: first by applying stepwise regression and then by accounting for multicollinearity among the remaining predictors.
						In the stepwise regression, the p-value of each predictor had to be below 0.6 for the predictor to be kept in the regression. In the multicollinearity test, the Variation Inflation Factor threshold was of 10.
						<br>The final remaining variables were therefore carbon sequestration (<b>x<sub>1</sub></b>), spread (<b>x<sub>2</sub></b>) and height (<b>x<sub>3</sub></b>).
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class = 'infoCard' id="Prediction">
					<h3>Model Outcome</h3>
					<p>
						The model predicts future pollution removal each year by the London Plane trees over a period of five years (2020 to 2025).
						The future values of carbon sequestration(<b>x<sub>1</sub></b>), spread (<b>x<sub>2</sub></b>) and height (<b>x<sub>3</sub></b>) with which the model was applied were assigned based on <a href="https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/TreeDetail.cfm?ItemID=904" class="link">external research on the London Plane tree</a> where we found that:
						<ul>
							<li> Carbon sequestration increases by 2.5 kilograms per year </li>
							<li> Spread increases by 0.5 meters per year </li>
							<li> Height increases by one meter per year </li>
						</ul>
						By being linear, the model also assumes the relation between those predictors and the outcome is the same for all trees.

					<p>
						This is a simple model that provides an initial understanding of the potential that trees bring to Camden in terms of environmental, social and economic sustainability.
						The model is reliable in raising such awareness as it satisfies three out of four assumptions of linear regression and has high explanatory power.
						However, the model cannot predict the exact environmental, social and economic value of trees. First,
						the quality and meaning of certain data entries is questionable as the Borough of Camden has provided little to no metadata on the definition, reliability and collection method of each variable.
						Moreover, the relation between the predictors and the outcome is dependent on the maturity of the trees which is ignored by the model.
						Finally, this relation is not exactly linear, but other tested relations did not yield satisfactory results, explaining why this model was kept among others.

					<br>
					<p style= "font-size: 16px;font-weight: 300">
					This tool allows us to see two main things. First: we observe that wards in the North and the North-West of Camden borough
						will witness a higher increase in pollution removal over the next five years compared to the
					  	rest of the Borough. This will have an effect of smoothing out the hotspot of pollution
						removal in the South of the borough.
						Second, according to our model, the highest coefficient is the 
						one related to tree spread. This means that tree spread is highly correlated to the change
						in pollution removal by the London Plane; the bigger the London Plane tree, the bigger the
						change in pollution removal by that tree!
