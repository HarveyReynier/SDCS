					The aim of this website is to visualise the impact that the urban forest presently has on pollution removal, and could have in the future. We selected the Borough of Camden, but as this tool is reproducible, the same aim can be applied on any borough providing similar data variables. There is a multitude of websites that visualise the impact of trees in the urban context. <a href="https://maps.london.gov.uk/green-infrastructure/" target="_blank" class="link">Some</a> are complex and require scientific insight, <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/treepedia" target="_blank" class="link">some</a> aim to establish tools that can be used across cities to assess urban forestry, and <a href="https://www.treetalk.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="link">some</a> are easily accessible to the public. The nature of these websites aims is largely related to the people behind them (government authorities, scientists, urban explorersâ€¦). In our case, we are no tree experts, just a <a href="./group.html" class="link">group</a> of tree enthusiasts, and we wanted to share our enthusiasm for trees with people in an accessible form!
					<br> We mapped out the presence of these trees and the impact this presence has on the pollution removal in Camden. We explored the data that we extracted from <a href="https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/Environment/Trees-In-Camden/csqp-kdss" target="_blank" class="link">Camden Council Tree Dataset</a>. Then we analysed this data to build a <a href="./regression.html" target="_blank" class="link">predictive tool</a> that answers our aim to explore future tree contribution towards pollution removal. We hope you enjoy exploring our website as much as we enjoyed building it!

					<p>	The most common type of tree in the Camden Council is the <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/london-plane/" target="_blank" class="link">London Plane tree </a>. It is the capitalâ€™s most common tree. Itâ€™s been widely planted since the 18th century; 3 centuries and counting! The second most common type of trees in Camden is the <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/common-lime/" target="_blank" class="link">Common Lime </a>. An interesting fact about this tree is that both male and female trees produce white-yellow flowers. Itâ€™s also a native tree to the UK and very common in urban areas and parks. The third most common type is the <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/norway-maple/" target="_blank" class="link">Norway Maple</a>. Birds and small mammals love feasting on the leaves of this tree thatâ€™s been around for 4 centuries now. Itâ€™s widely planted in parks and on urban streets because this tree is very resilient to the harsh environmental conditions of cities such as compact soil, pollution, shade and because its trunk is tall, remaining clear from circulation.

Amenity trees are part of the urban forest system, which are trees within public domain and that authorities are therefore responsible for. CAVAT is a tool that is used by authorities in assets management to know the replacement value needed to compensate for a single tree or for a population of trees.<br>
							In the case of Camden Council, we focused on the CAVAT for the most common trees as they have the largest aggregated CAVAT values per ward. This might be related to how common they are in each ward, but also to the fact that they are the largest (in overall dimensions of height, spread and Diameter at Breast Height).

				In this chart we inspect the amount of pollution removed by trees in each ward. This chart allows us to visually compare these quantities across wards. We separated the 3 most common types of trees (the London Plane, the Common Lime and the Noway Maple) from the rest. What we see in most wards is that the pollution removed by these top trees equals the pollution removed by other tree types. In some wards such as St Pancras and Somers Town and Kingâ€™s Cross, the pollution removed by the top 3 exceeds that removed by other types. In other wards such as West Hampstead, Kilburn and Highgate it is the opposite case. This is easily explained by the presence of significantly large parks in these wards such as Hampstead heath, Regentâ€™s park and others that have a wide array of tree species that outnumber and outdo the roadside trees elsewhere. We also note the significant impact of the London Plane on the pollution removal in most wards, namely Bloomsbury and Holborn and Covent Garden. We further explore the environmental impact of this cardinal species in our next section.
