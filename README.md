## How to use Git and GitHub
I followed these nifty tutorials to understand how Git and Github works!

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) on 'git' was very useful, along with the
accompanying [notes](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-to-Git-ac396a0697704709a12b6a0e545db049#d5e9c2b6379246a593c1ef74051e7e3c).
The same person made another tutorial on [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s), again here are the accompanying [notes](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-to-GitHub-202af6f64bbd4299b15f238dcd09d2a7).
